# Cifar10_tensorflow
I tried to compile different cnn net using tensorflow based on cifar10 dataset.
## How to run
- First,you can git clone this code :
-   
    git clone https://github.com/xunhui-huang/Cifar10_tensorflow.git 
- Second,you can run the code:
-
    python main.py
    also,you can adopt different networks by changing the content of main.py.
## Warning
- This is just a coarse impletation,you can improve net accuracy by further adjusting the super parameters.
## Reference
-  Thanks for the awesome work from the following:
